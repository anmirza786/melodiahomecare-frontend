                  Hospice is a way of caring for and supporting a person
                  diagnosed with a terminal illness. Hospice care focuses on
                  providing comfort and pain management, rather than providing a
                  curative treatment. Hospice not only supports the patient but
                  also their family and is offered in whatever setting is most
                  comfortable – whether your home is a house, an apartment or an
                  assisted living facility. Hospice is a family focused, team
                  approach and Divine Hospice has a team of professionals here
                  to care for the patient’s needs, as well as their loved ones.
